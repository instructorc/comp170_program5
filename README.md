# Program 5: MPLS Dog Management System
**Programs 5 and 6 will be similar in functionality.**
The MPLS Dog Boarding company would like for you to create an application that allows for a care attendant to be able 
to create, retrieve and update dog records from the system. MPLS Dog Boarding can only have 12 dogs in their care at a time. When you select the option to **create** a dog record.  You will 
enter the dog's id, dog's name, weight and dog's age  Once information is entered for a dog, the program will display
entered information and reprompt the care attendent to select an option to exit, display, create or update dog records.  When the **update** option
is selected the care attendant will be presented with option to enter the dog's id number and reassign information
pertaining to dog.  When the **retrieve** option is selected, the user will be able to enter the dog's id and be presented
with dog information.

**Hints**
- Consider the use of parallel arrays to store dog Data.  **Declare your arrays at the class level and not in the main method.**
- Consider commenting your code and writing the code in the main method before modularizing the program.

Your program should operate similarly to the program shown in the .gif below The .gif below show three iterations of running the program

#### Listed below is a detailed explanation of the requirements needed to complete the dog management system.  

## Requirement 1 (5 Points) 
Variables are properly declared and initialized; Use of Scanner Object to read input from console. Make use of constant final variables. 
Whenever possible, make sure to declare all variables that will hold data along with declaring final variables that will not change during runtime.
Proper structure used for allowing the end-user to continously select menu option until a sentinel value is entered.

## Requirement 2 (5 Points) 
Input/Output of all necessary information for each item entry; Program properly makes use of arrays/multi-dimensional arrays to structure data;
Program only accepts dog id numbers that have been entered.

## Requirement 3 (5 Points) 
The program should consist of a minimum of 5 methods.  
    1) A welcome method that describes the program.  
    2) A method to display the selection prompt
